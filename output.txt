Once upon a time, there was a video game developer who loved to make the most innovative games. One day, they decided to make a game about a group of llamas who needed to chop down trees to build their village. The game was an instant hit, and the developer became a millionaire. They spent their money on luxurious vacations, fancy cars, and a pet alpaca named Fluffy.
