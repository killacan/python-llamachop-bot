# Llamachop Bot

## new and improved llamachop bot

This is an updated version of my previous llamachop bot. It is written in python and utilizes blenderbot to generate responses. Right now I am getting it working on my twitch channel, but I eventually want to make it work for any twitch channel.

Code is set to to easily run the chatbot in terminal. Model runs locally on GPU, I have not tested it on CPU. I am using a 1080ti. Code could be changed to allow for other models to be used, might add in an easy way to connect with an API in the future. 

## Functionality

To interact with the bot, type !bot in chat at the start of your message.

## Planned Features

Eventually I want this bot to be able to not only converse with chat, but also have a point system and games that can be played with chat. A lot of the purpose of this project was to create something interactive for small streamers to use for increased engagement. 

I also want to be able to use better models for the chatbot, but at the moment blenderbot is the best I can do with my hardware.
